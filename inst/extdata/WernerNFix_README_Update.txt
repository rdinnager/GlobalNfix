File Description WernerNfix.csv.

This file contains the full symbiotic N2-fixation database we compiled, a subset of which was analysed in Werner et al. (2014). 
For those species that were analysed in Werner et al. (2014), analysis results can be found in the Supplementary Data 2 to Werner et al. (2014).  
Please note that manual evaluation of reliability of N2-fixation reports, and of species names, was only performed for those species that were analysed in Werner et al. (2014).  
For all other species, proceed with caution when using this database. Ideally, verify reports, particularly for influential data points and perform analyses to account for sensitivity of results to data errors (see Methods Werner et al. (2014)). 
Even for the manually evaluated species, no guarantees regarding the reliability of data points can be given. Again, be careful in interpreting results, and consider performing analyses to account for sensitivity to errors in the data. 
Full references to all data sources, including all TRY data contributors and associated references, can be found below under 'Data References' and in Werner et al. (2014), Supplementary Table 3, and. 

Description of variables

Species: Genus and species name
NFC: Is the species in the Nitrogen-Fixing Clade (Soltis et al. 1995)?
Legume: Is the species a legume? 
Order: Order of the species
Family: Family of the species
Data_fixing: Does the species engage in symbiotic N2-fixation with bacterial N2-fixing symbionts (nodulation)?
Source: Main source of the data: TRY, GRIN, Sprent2001, Sprent2009 or Manual (directly from primary literature), see Methods of Werner et al. 2014 for more information. 
Source2: Details on data source. In the case of TRY-data: last name of data contributor. GRIN: no further information. Sprent2001 & Sprent2009: Location of information in the volume. Manual: primary reference. See Table S3 in Werner et al. (2014) or below under Data References for full references. 
Data_corrected: Were reports of absence/presence of symbiotic N2-fixation corrected after manual evaluation of the reliability of the report?
Species_corrected: Were species names corrected following suggestions from the the Taxonomic Name Resolution Service (TNRS), or after manual evaluation?
Analysed_Werner_etal.: Was this species analysed in Werner et al. 2014?
